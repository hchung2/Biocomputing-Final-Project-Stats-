##MC Linear/ANOVA simulation

#Set Parameters

#For each type sd error (1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24)
#Repeat 10 times

#Generate random uniform numbers 0:50 for x
#generate set of numbers y based off y = 0.4x +10
#add some normally distributed error to y based on sd error

##Linear Regression
#test linear regression, same code as example question 2.

##ANOVAs
#generate a matrix to represent groups for 2,4,8 level ANOVAs
#adjust functions to have additional variables in function based on level of ANOVA

#keep output of Linear Regressiosn and test in a vector
#Store the mean of that vector in a matrix

#Final Output is matrix.
